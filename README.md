This is my version of the Turing challenge where I am expected to consume a number of endpoint and design the UI.

This application is a web e-commerce site that allows a user do a number of things like


* Users can view all items when entering the website
* Users can select a department and category to filter products
* Users can search items through search box
* Users can see item details by selecting a specific item
* Users can add items to their shopping carts
* Users can register/login
* Users can update personal profiles with shipping addresses and other info
